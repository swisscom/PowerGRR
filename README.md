## What is PowerGRR? 

PowerGRR is a **PowerShell module for the
[GRR](https://github.com/google/grr) API working on Windows, macOS and
Linux**. GRR Rapid Response is an incident response framework focused on
remote live forensics. PowerGRR allows working with flows, hunts, labels,
artifacts, approvals and the search feature. Furthermore, it allows **working
with the computer names instead of the GRR internal client id**. This makes
handling and working with other tools more easy because often you just have
the computer names. PowerGRR also enables you to easily document your work in
text form which is then directly reusable by others.

Some of the use cases where PowerGRR could speed up the work:
* Start a flow on one or multiple clients and get flow results as PowerShell
    object for easier filtering. Download collected files directly from
    command line.
* Create and start a new hunt and get the hunt info or results as PowerShell
    objects. Download collected files directly from command line.
* [Create a hunt or a client approval request and wait until they get valid](https://github.com/swisscom/powergrr/wiki#commands-for-using-the-grr-approval-system).
* Add or remove a label on one or multiple clients based on a list of computer
    names.
* Add artifacts to or remove artifacts from the GRR artifact repository.
* List clients, flows, hunts, artifacts, labels, client or hunt approvals and
  filter them in different ways.
* Build [IR scripts for common forensic workflows and start multiple hunts or
    flows in one shot using multiple cmdlets inside a PowerShell script](https://github.com/swisscom/PowerGRR/wiki/Live-response-collection-script).

The following flow types are available for hunts and flows and the target group
is chosen based on labels or the OS. See also [command
help](https://github.com/swisscom/PowerGRR/blob/master/docs/Invoke-GRRFlow.md#description)
for the available flow types.
* Netstat, ListProcesses, FileFinder, RegistryFinder, ExecutePythonHack, ArtifactCollectorFlow, YaraProcessScan

## Installation

* **Install PowerGRR from [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PowerGRR/)**. [PowerShellGet](https://github.com/powerShell/powershellget) is required which is installed in PowerShell Core and since Windows PowerShell v5 by default. Only released versions are available there, see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

    ``` powershell
    # Inspect
    Save-Module -Name PowerGRR -Path <path> 

    # Install
    Install-Module -Name PowerGRR -Scope CurrentUser

    # Update
    Update-Module -Name PowerGRR
    ```
   
   If you get an error, try using the following command to set PowerShell Gallery as one of your repositories:
   
   ``` powershell
   Register-PSRepository -Default
   ```
   
* Install PowerGRR from Github:

    * Clone or download the repo into your module path folder, usually
      _~\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\modules_ on Windows or
      _~/.local/share/powershell/Modules/_ on macOS (see _$env:PSModulePath_).
    * Clone or download the files to any other folder (could also be a share).
    * **Windows** Make sure to unblock the files when downloaded from the
        Internet by opening the properties page of the .psd1 and .psm1 files and
        checking "Unblock" at the bottom.

    The location changes how the module is imported.

## Configuration

1. Create a 'powergrr-config.ps1' in the profile folder (`$env:USERPROFILE` or
`$env:HOME`) or in the root folder of the module.
1. Set the config variables as needed. 
   * **[MUST]** _$GRRUrl_: GRR server's URL.
   * **[OPTIONAL]** _$GRRIgnoreCertificateErrors_: If set to $true certificate errors are ignored.
   * **[OPTIONAL]** _$GRRClientCertIssuer_:  If set, the client certificate
                    from the Windows cert store signed by the given issuer is used.
   * **[OPTIONAL]** _$GRRClientCertFilePath_: If set, the client certificate
                   file is used for the authentication.

It's also possible to set these variables in the console.

**Example Configs**

``` PowerShell
$GRRUrl = "https://grrserver.tld"
```

``` PowerShell
$GRRUrl = "https://grrserver.tld"
$GRRClientCertIssuer = "issuer of the certificate for client auth"
```

If you want to get crazy you could even use a config file file looking
like this if you need to constantly change the GRR config otherwise. You only
need to change the comment for the GRRUrl.

``` powershell
#$GRRUrl = "https://main-grrserver.tld"
$GRRUrl = "https://test-grrserver.tld"
$GRRIgnoreCertificateErrors = $( if ($GRRUrl -match "test") { $true } )
$GRRClientCertIssuer = $( if ($GRRUrl -match "main") { "certificate issuer" } )
```

## Usage

Use `command -<tab>` to tab between the available parameters or use 
`command -<ctrl+space>` to display a list of all paremeters. Some commands 
use dynamic parameters which are only available after selecting the main one, 
e.g. in `Invoke-GRRFlow` first choose your flow type with `-Flow ...` and then
the flow-specific parameters become available.

### Import

If PowerGRR was saved inside the module path run the following command:
```
Import-Module PowerGRR -force
```

If PowerGRR was saved outside the module path run the command:

```
Import-Module <path to module>\PowerGRR.psd1 -force
```

### Authentication

1. Store your GRR credentials for any subsequent PowerGRR command or otherwise
you will be prompted when running the commands. Either provide the credentials
with `-Credential` in each command or use the variable `$GRRCredential` to set
the credentials which then will be used without the need for supplying
`-Credential`.

```powershell
$GRRCredential = Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\get-credential
```

2. If you use client certificate authentication set the corresponding config
variable as described in [Configuration](#configuration) above.

### Cmdlets

Please see [docs](docs/PowerGRR.md) for the list of all available commands and the
[wiki](https://github.com/swisscom/PowerGRR/wiki) for further information how
you could use and combine the different PowerGRR commands.

Use the common parameters like _-WhatIf_ or _-Verbose_ for troubleshooting and to
see what the commands would do. _WhatIf_ is implemented for every function which
make any permanent change (e.g. start a flow, set a label, ...).

List available PowerGRR commands.

```powershell
get-command -Module PowerGRR
```

List all PowerGRR commands for flows.

```powershell
get-command -Module PowerGRR | sls flow
```

### Help

Use `help <command>` to get the help for a command.

```powershell
PS> help Get-GRRHuntInfo

NAME
    Get-GRRHuntInfo

OVERVIEW
    Get hunt info for a specific hunt.

SYNTAX
    Get-GRRHuntInfo [[-HuntId] <String>] [-Credential] <PSCredential> [-ShowJSON] [<CommonParameters>]
...
```

Use `help <command> -Examples` to get examples for a command.

```powershell
PS> help Get-GRRHuntInfo -Examples

NAME
    Get-GRRHuntInfo

OVERVIEW
    Get hunt info for a specific hunt.

    Example 1

    PS C:\> Get-GRRHuntInfo "H:AAAAAAAA" -Credential $cred
...
```

### Example

The following examples shows how you could combine the different PowerGRR functions
to quickly label some clients, start a flow against them or a hunt based on a label
and read the results. You can find more code snippets and ideas in the
[wiki](https://github.com/swisscom/PowerGRR/wiki) and see section
[help](#help) above how to use the help system in PowerShell.

Use `$GRRCredential` for setting the credentials before running the commands
and the parameter `-Credential` is not needed anymore for each command.

```powershell
# Read the client information to check LastSeenAt and the OSVersion
Get-GRRClientIdFromComputerName -ComputerName WIN-DESKTOP01,MBP-LAPTOP02,WIN-DESKTOP03,WIN-DESKTOP04 `
